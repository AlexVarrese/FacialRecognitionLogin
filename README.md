# Facial Recognition Login
An iOS and Android app that uses facial recognition to enhance the security of a login page. 

Built using Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft Cognitive Services.

## Getting Started - iOS

To launch this app on a physical iOS device, you must create a custom Provisioning Profile that uses an App Groups Entitlement. 

The Xamarin Developer docs have a walkthough to accomplish this: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/working-with-app-groups/

Note that BundleIDs and AppGroups are case-sensitive. I recommend using only lowercase letters for the app group name and BundleId.
